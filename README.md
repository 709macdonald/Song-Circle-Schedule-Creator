# Song Circle Schedule Creator

**Get Coding Project**

Song Circle Schedule Creator is a web-based application designed to simplify scheduling for singing competitions. It runs on any browser and is written in HTML, CSS, and client side JavaScript.

## Overview

This tool helps organizers schedule events by automating the creation of iCal events based on festival and participant data.

## Motivation 

My parents are both music teachers in St. John's, Newfoundland. Over the past few years, I've noticed the lack of scheduling applications for community singing festivals. These events often take weeks to organize, requiring applications, matching adjudicators, and planning schedules. With the Song Circle Schedule Creator, I hope to solve this problem. This version of the application is specifically focused on my parents' music festival, Song Circles.

## Usage

### Step 1: Festival Information

Fill out festival details including name, location, and dates. These details will be used for generating iCal events.

### Step 2: Class Information

Define class details to determine class lengths. The calculation includes participant counts, adjudication writing time, performance lengths, adjudication time, buffer time, and spacing between classes.

### Step 3: Upload Spreadsheet

Upload a spreadsheet (preferably from Google Forms) with participant details. Ensure the spreadsheet headers are in the correct order:

1. Submission Time
2. First Name
3. Last Name
4. Song Title
5. Composer
6. Performance Length (in seconds)
7. Class
8. Class Number
9. Participant Age
10. Email

**Note:** Sorting and scheduling rely on accurate Class Numbers in the spreadsheet.
**Note:** If no schedule shows up after processing this is likely due to spreadsheet formatting.

## Requirements

- JavaScript-enabled browser environment
