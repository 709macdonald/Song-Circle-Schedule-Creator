# Song Circle Schedule Creator

**Get Coding Project**

Song Circle Schedule Creator is a web-based application designed to simplify scheduling for singing competitions. It runs on Google Chrome and is written in JavaScript.

## Overview

This tool helps organizers schedule events by automating the creation of iCal events based on festival and participant data.

## Usage

### Step 1: Festival Information

Fill out festival details including name, location, and dates. These details will be used for generating iCal events.

### Step 2: Class Information

Define class details to determine class lengths. The calculation includes participant counts, adjudication writing time, performance lengths, adjudication time, buffer time, and spacing between classes.

### Step 3: Upload Spreadsheet

Upload a spreadsheet (preferably from Google Forms) with participant details. Ensure the spreadsheet headers are in the correct order:

1. Submission Time
2. First Name
3. Last Name
4. Song Title
5. Composer
6. Performance Length (in seconds)
7. Class
8. Class Number
9. Participant Age
10. Email

**Note:** Sorting and scheduling rely on accurate Class Numbers in the spreadsheet.
